#### Numerical ESP Data

_As of May 2021, BRCA Exchange has retired the display of the ESP data in favor gnomAD, which has incorporated most of the ESP content. We still have historic ESP data in our database, as reflected in the Variant History section of the Variant Details Page._

The NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) is a contributor of allele frequency data to the BRCA Exchange. The Exome Sequencing Project \(ESP\) aims to “to discover novel genes and mechanisms contributing to heart, lung and blood disorders by pioneering the application of next-generation sequencing of the protein coding regions of the human genome across diverse, richly-phenotyped populations and to share these datasets and findings with the scientific community to extend and enrich the diagnosis, management and treatment of heart, lung and blood disorders” \([NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project](http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/)\).

* #### Allele Frequency (ESP) ((Allele_Frequency_ESP))
	Allele frequency in entire data set, per ESP
* #### EA Allele Frequency (ESP) ((EA_Allele_Frequency_ESP))
	Allele frequency in European-American populations, per ESP
* #### AA Allele Frequency (ESP) ((AA_Allele_Frequency_ESP))
	Allele frequency in African-American populations, per ESP
