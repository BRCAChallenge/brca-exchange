The assays in the Functional Assay Results tile were selected by the ENIGMA consortium as high-quality published assays that met internal standards permitting estimation of sensitivity and specificity (see [Parsons et al, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31131967/))

For each publication selected, we present the following information in the header of the sub-tile, as key information to be communicated whether or not the tile is collapsed:

* Genetic variation can impact RnA transcripts and/or protein function or abundance. Publications labeled with a **P** measure the impact of genetic variation at the protein level, while those labeled with **R/P** measure the impact of variation at both the RNA and the protein level.  We currently include no assays that measure only RNA-level effects.
* The authors' name and the publication year
* The **Report** field, indicating the authors' report or overall interpretation of the functional impact of the variant, given all experiments performed, and as published by the authors.  If the Report is ''Many Provided'', the authors have provided many different sets of results, but no overall interpretation

In the body of the tile, we present those fields and others:
* The **Report Descriptions** field, which summarizes the possible values for the Report field
* The **Publication** field, which provides a link to the publication
* The **Previous Publications** field, which lists the authorsâ€™ previous publications, results of which may have been incorporated into the current publication
* Where relevant, the results of each individual assay published in the paper 

When working with functional assay data, please be aware that these data reflect laboratory models of disease, and should not be used as a substitute for clinical variant interpretation.  Further, please note that irrespective of the different terms that might be used by authors to reflect impact on function (e.g. deleterious, pathogenic), the results presented **do not reflect a final variant classification**.
