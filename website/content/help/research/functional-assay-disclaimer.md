The assays in the Functional Assay Results tile were selected by the ENIGMA working groups as high-quality, informative published assays that met internal standards for sensitivity and specificity.

For each publication selected, we present:
* The authors' name and the publication year
* The **Result** field, indicating the authors' overall interpretation of the functional impact of the variant, given all experiments performed, and as published by the authors.  If the Result is ''Many Provided'', the authors have provided many different sets of results, but no overall interpretation

These information are presented in the header of each sub-tile.  Additionally, in the body of the tile, we present:
* The **Result Descriptions** field, which summarizes the possible values for the Result field
* The authors' previous publications, if any
* The results of each individual assay published in the paper
* A link to the publication

When working with functional assay data, please be aware that these data reflect laboratory models of disease, and should not be used as a substitute for clinical variant interpretation.
