_As of May 2021, BRCA Exchange has retired the display of 1000 Genomes data in favor of gnomAD, which has incorporated most of the 1000 Genomes content.  We still have historic 1000 Genomes data in our database, as reflected in the Variant History section of the Variant Details Page._

The 1000 Genomes Project contributes allele frequency data to BRCA Exchange. The goal of the 1000 Genomes Project is “to provide a comprehensive description of common human genetic variation by applying whole-genome sequencing to a diverse set of individuals from multiple populations” \([The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393)\).  Whereas ExAC aggregates sequence data, 1000 Genomes works on adding new, more diverse genomes to existing data sets.

For more information about 1000 Genomes, please visit the [International Genome Sample Resource](http://www.internationalgenome.org/) website or their [publications](http://www.internationalgenome.org/1000-genomes-project-publications).

#### Graphical 1000 Genomes Data
Graphical 1000 Genomes data can be viewed by expanding the 1000 Genomes \(Numerical\) nested tile. Two Graphs are available; one of the graphs is custom scaled to the allele frequencies by default \(right side\). Hovering over each bar will give you the numerical value represented in the population subset. You can click anywhere on the 1000 Genomes \(scaled\) graph to change the scale between 1.0% (.01), 0.1% (.001), and the custom, default scale. This variety of scales will allow you to view all possible Allele Frequencies graphically.

Each group found on the x-axis of the bar chart can be found in the list of fields described in the 1000 Genomes \(Numerical\) section.

#### Numerical 1000 Genomes Data
Numerical 1000 Genomes data fields show numerical minor allele frequency data associated with each population, as well as the overall allele frequency. All of the minor allele frequencies are consistent with the graphs shown in the 1000 Genomes \(Graphical\) nested tile.
