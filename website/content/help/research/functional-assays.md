Many BRCA functional assays interrogate the impact of the variant on *homologous DNA repair (HDR)* or on drug sensitivity.

Homologous DNA repair is one of the key functions of *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*, and describes the cell's ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks under certain circumstances.  Many HDR assays are *cell survival* assays; HDR is essential to the life of the cell, so when the cell is subjected to mutational processes to incur DNA damage, cell life or death is one indication of HDR activity.

*PARP inhibitors* are a family of pharmaceutical drugs that inhibit the cell's ability to repair single-strand DNA breaks, a circumstance which eventually leads to double-strand DNA breaks.  Cells which contain pathogenic *BRCA* variants lack the HDR activity necessary to repair these double-strand breaks, leading to cell death.  This makes cells with pathogenic *BRCA* variants sensitive to PARP inhibition.  PARP inhibitors include the drugs Olaparib, Rucaparib, Niraparib and Talazoparib.

#### Findlay et al, 2018

This MAVE assay (Multiplexed Assay of Variant Effects) interrogated roughly 3900 *BRCA1* variants, comprising most possible missense variants in the 13 exons that comprise the RING and BRCT domains.  The authors performed a homologous DNA Repair cell survival assay in the human haploid cell line HAP1, and also measured the impact of the variant on RNA production.
