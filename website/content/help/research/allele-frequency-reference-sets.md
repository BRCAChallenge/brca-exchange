The Allele Frequency Reference Sets tile shows the frequency of a _BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_ variant in a reference population from the gnomAD resource. Allele Frequencies can be helpful in understanding the frequency at which a variant appears in the population, and whether there is a population in which the variant is so common that it's not likely to increase the risk of a much less common disease. Different sets (exome, genome) are shown in different subtiles. To view or collapse all subtiles, click the arrows at the top right of the tile on the Variant Details Page.
